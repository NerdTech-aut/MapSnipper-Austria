### What is MapSnipper?
MapSnipper is a tool which lets you create detailed coverage maps for all cellular operators in Austria.  
The tool currently supports the following operators:
- A1 Telekom Austria | Technologies: 2G, 3G, 4G & 5G NSA | Frequencies: 800, 900, 1800, 2100, 2600 & 3500 MHz
- Magenta Telekom | Technologies: 5G NSA | Frequencies: 3500 MHz
- Hutchison Drei Austria | Technologies: 5G NSA | Frequencies: 3500 MHz
- Mass Response aka. Spusu | Technologies: 5G SA | Frequencies: 3500 MHz
- LIWEST | Technologies: 5G FWA | Frequencies: 3500 MHz
- Graz Holding Citycom | Technologies: 5G FWA | Frequencies: 3500 MHz
- Salzburg AG Cable Link Air | Technologies: 5G FWA | Frequencies: 3500 MHz  

Additionally, you can see all cell sites from A1, Magenta and Drei.

### Where is the data coming from?
MapSnipper uses the publicly available data which is provided by the cellular companies.  
All the data can be found through the links on this [site of the RTR](https://www.rtr.at/TKP/was_wir_tun/telekommunikation/spectrum/bands/3400-3800MHz/Spectrum3400MHz.de.html).  
The cell site data was provided by Jonas12 aka. JonasGhost and stems from [senderkataster.at](senderkataster.at).

### Why use this tool?
All of the companies who publish the data used by this tool also provide a graphical representation of the data.  
But these graphical representations can lack depth and therefore aren't useful.    
This tool makes all of the data visible in a way that is easy to understand.  
Furthermore, it makes comparing theoretical coverage across operators easier than ever before.

### What does MapSnipper do:
MapSnipper generates an HTML file with a detailed map.  
This HTML file can be viewed in a web browser.  
By default, this tool generates a 10 by 10 kilometer map with as much data as it can find.

### Limitations:
- Performance: More data means a more resource intensive map. The default radius is a compromise between performance/resource consumption and usefulness.  
- Not all frequencies: Magenta does currently not provide data for 700, 800, 900, 1800, 2100 and 2600 MHz and Drei does currently not provide data for 900, 1800, 2100 and 2600 MHz
- Cell sites: The cell site data lacks operator information. This means you can't see which cell site is operated by which operator. 

## Get started:
### Download this repository:
You can download this repository either as a zip archive or through git.
If you want to go through git I recon you know what you are doning.
Otherwise just download this repository as a zip archive. You can do this by clicking on the green "Code" button and then choose "Download ZIP". After the download is complete extract the zip archive.

### Useful software for Windows Users:
If you use Windows 10 or 11 you can make your life a lot easier if you download the [Windows Terminal App from the Microsoft Store](https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9N0DX20HK701)
 
### Python:
Make sure you have python installed on your machine.  
If you are not sure if python is already installed on your computer run this command in a terminal window:
```
python -V
```
If python isnâ€™t installed, please download the lasted version.  
[python download page](https://www.python.org/downloads/)  
[python on the Microsoft store for Windows 10 & 11](https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9PJPW5LDXLZ5)

### Python packages:   
After python was successfully installed, please install the following packages:
- pyproj
- folium  

I have prepared a file to make the installation of these packages easier.  
If you use Windows and have Windows Terminal installed right click in the MapSnipper folder which contains the three files above and select "Open in Terminal". This opens a new Windows Terminal window at the right location.  
Everyone else just open a Terminal and navigate to the folder with the three files above.  
All you need to do now is run this command:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### Additional software:
If you use Windows please download and install the [Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable packages for Visual Studio 2015, 2017, 2019, and 2022](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe).

### Download coverage and cell site data:
To be able to use this project you need additional data which is not included in this repository. You can download this data from my OneDrive.  [MapSnipper_Data.zip](https://1drv.ms/u/s!Ajecn6-yGfx0iHryUTPootTeHdSS?e=IdwTYy)  
After the download is completed unzip the folder and move the 13 csv files into the same folder as the three files above. At the end you should have one folder with 16 files.
